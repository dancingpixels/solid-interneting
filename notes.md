## HTML Elements Types

There are 2 types of  major HTML elements:

1. `block-level` elements also know as `flow` elements.

   - `block level` elements are always drawn on a new line.

   ```html
   <p>, <h1>...</h1>, <ol>, <li>...</li>
   ```

2. `inline` elements known as `phrasing` elements.

   - `inline` elements can affect sections of text anywhere within a line.

   ```html
   <em>...</em> <!-- affects the span of a text inside a paragraph -->
   <strong>...</strong>
   ```

## Self Closing Elements

Some elements can be `empty` or `self-closing`. Line breaks and horizontal rules are the most common empty elements youâ€™ll find.

```html
<br/> <!-- line break -->
<hr/> <!-- thematic break -->
```
