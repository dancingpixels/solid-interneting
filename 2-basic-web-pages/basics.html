	<h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
	<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

	<h2>Headings define the outline of your site.</h2>
	<p>There are six levels of headings.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Add a 'ul' element - it stands for unordered lists.</li>
		<li>Add each item in its own 'li' element.</li>
		<li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Notice the ol element wrapping everything.</li>
		<li>But, the list items are the same.</li>
		<li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own.</li>
		<li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
	<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
	<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Sometimes, you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

	<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

	<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
